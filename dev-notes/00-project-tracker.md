## Overview

Registration Guard is a lightweight WordPress plugin that layers three defences against bot registration: a JavaScript nonce challenge, email double opt-in with auto-cleanup, and geo-restriction (via WooCommerce geolocation). It works with both native WordPress registration and WooCommerce My Account registration.

## Decision Log

Resolved 2026-03-09:

| ID | Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|----------|-----------|
| D1 | Nonce endpoint: REST API vs admin-ajax? | **admin-ajax.php** with referer validation | REST API is already abused by bots. Admin-ajax is universally excluded by page caches and reverse proxies. Endpoint must reject requests with no/invalid referer — don't even issue a nonce. |
| D2 | Deletion logging mechanism? | **Custom table** (`{prefix}rg_log`) | Logs key events (verification sent, account deleted, nonce rejected, geo blocked, etc.). Daily cron prunes entries older than 30 days. Simple schema: event_type, user_id, message, ip, timestamp. |
| D3 | Interstitial for unverified users? | **`wp_die()`** with contextual message | Works regardless of theme. Include "Resend verification email" link and "Check your spam folder" guidance. HTTP 403 response code. |
| D4 | Nonce challenge on checkout? | **No — dedicated registration forms only** | Checkout must be completely unaffected. No JS enqueued, no nonce fields, no backend validation. Checkout has its own CSRF nonce. Risk of disrupting sales is unacceptable. |
| D5 | Existing users on activation? | **No meta = verified** (no retroactive changes) | Don't write meta to existing users. Verification check logic: `_rg_email_verified` exists AND equals `false` → block. No meta → pass through. This also handles pre-existing users naturally. |
| D6 | Verification email format? | **Plain text only** (permanent decision) | Better deliverability, passes anti-spam filters, simpler. No HTML version planned. Content-Type: `text/plain; charset=UTF-8`. |
| D7 | REST API / admin user creation? | **Exclude from verification** | REST API requires `create_users` cap (WordPress) or API key auth (WooCommerce). Detect via `REST_REQUEST` constant. Admin-created users detected via `current_user_can('create_users')`. WP-CLI detected via `WP_CLI` constant. All write `_rg_email_verified = true` to distinguish from legacy users. |

Additional decisions from discussion:

| ID | Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|----------|-----------|
| D8 | Checkout registration handling? | **Auto-approve** — write `_rg_email_verified = true` | Detect via `did_action( 'woocommerce_checkout_process' ) > 0`. Payment acts as proof of legitimacy. Write explicit `true` meta to distinguish from legacy "no meta" users. |
| D9 | Resend rate limiting approach? | **Single cooldown** (default 5 minutes) | Simpler than max-attempts-per-window. One transient `rg_resend_cooldown_{user_id}` with TTL = cooldown setting. If transient exists, block resend. One setting instead of two. |
| D10 | Email change re-verification? | **Not in v1** (conscious exclusion) | Primary threat model is bot account creation, not email changes. Would add significant complexity. Can revisit in v2 if needed. |
| D11 | Password reset for unverified users? | **Not blocked in v1** (conscious exclusion) | Low priority — unverified accounts are auto-deleted anyway. Could be a spam vector but risk is minimal. Can revisit if it becomes a real problem. |
| D12 | Verification meta states? | **Three-state model** | No meta → pre-existing/legacy user (treat as verified). `_rg_email_verified = true` → explicitly verified or auto-approved. `_rg_email_verified = false` → pending verification (block access). |
| D13 | WooCommerce REST API users? | **Covered by `REST_REQUEST` constant** | WooCommerce REST API (`/wc/v3/customers`) uses its own auth but still sets the `REST_REQUEST` constant. No separate detection needed. |

## Conscious v1 Exclusions

- **Multisite support** — single-site only
- **Email change re-verification** (D10)
- **Password reset blocking for unverified users** (D11)
- **Bundled GeoIP database** — geo-restriction requires WooCommerce
- **HTML verification emails** — plain text only (D6, permanent)
- **Nonce challenge on checkout** — checkout is completely untouched (D4, permanent)

## Technical Debt

_None yet — greenfield project._

## Notes for Development

- Reference Quick 2FA patterns at `/var/www/devx.headwall.tech/web/wp-content/plugins/quick-2fa/` for bootstrap, constants, settings, security, and email patterns.
- Quick 2FA uses plain text emails with `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8` — follow this pattern.
- Quick 2FA uses `wp_die()` for security blocks and full HTML renders for login-flow pages — we use `wp_die()` for interstitials.
- WooCommerce features degrade gracefully — the plugin must activate and function without WooCommerce.
- Target single-site WordPress only for v1 (no multisite support).
- PHP 8.0+ required — use type hints, union types, nullable types throughout.
